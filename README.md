# Eric S. Kulee — Cybersecurity (Vulnerability Mgmt • GRC • IAM)

I build repeatable security processes that reduce risk: **vulnerability prioritization**, **control evidence (GRC)**, and **access governance (IAM)**.  
My portfolio focuses on practical, hiring-relevant work: **scan → prioritize → remediate → report**, plus audit-ready documentation and identity lifecycle controls.

## Pinned Projects
### 1) VulnOps Pipeline (Scan → Normalize → Prioritize → Track → Report)
A vulnerability operations workflow that converts scan output into risk-based priorities, remediation SLAs, and executive/technical reports.  
**Skills:** vulnerability management, CVE/CVSS, triage, remediation tracking, reporting, automation (Python).

### 2) GRC Evidence Pack + Risk Register
A GRC starter kit with control mapping, audit-ready evidence structure, and a practical risk register with scoring and remediation tracking.  
**Skills:** GRC, controls, risk assessment, evidence management, policy/procedure structure, vendor risk.

### 3) IAM Lifecycle Lab (Joiner/Mover/Leaver + RBAC + Access Reviews)
An IAM lab demonstrating user lifecycle workflows, RBAC, deprovisioning, and access review reporting.  
**Skills:** IAM, RBAC, access reviews, provisioning/deprovisioning, least privilege, governance.

## Core Skills
- Vulnerability Management: triage, prioritization, remediation SLAs, reporting
- GRC: risk registers, control mapping, audit evidence, policy/procedure documentation
- IAM: joiner/mover/leaver, RBAC, access reviews, least privilege
